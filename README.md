# Sample weather app using Dark Sky API

## Project setup
This project makes use of two services: Google Places API (https://developers.google.com/places/android-api/) and Dark Sky weather API (https://darksky.net/dev/). In order to build & run this project, you'll need to register for an API key for the respective APIS and apply them to your `local.properties` file as follows:

```
places.api.key=<GOOGLE PLACES API KEY>
darksky.api.key=<DARKSKY API KEY>
```
